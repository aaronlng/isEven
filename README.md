# isEven

Exercise found in Chapter 3 of [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/).

  - Zero is even.

  - One is odd.

  - For any other number N, its evenness is the same as N - 2.

*Define a recursive function isEven corresponding to this description. The function should accept a single parameter (a positive, whole number) and return a Boolean.*

*Test it on 50 and 75. See how it behaves on -1. Why? Can you think of a way to fix this?*
